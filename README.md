I followed in this project the steps of the project management method called CRISP-DM. This method has undergone modifications aimed at the reality of a Data Science project and with that it was called CRISP-DS.

CRISP-DS has the following steps with their respective courts:

1 - Business Question
Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

2- Understanding the Business
This prediction will help assist in diagnosing future thyroid patients.
