# Hypothyroid Diagnosis Project

Collection of data of Nairobi Hospital Thyroid patients.

## Business Context
### Nairobi Hospital Thyroid Patients Data

Nairobi Hospital is a hospital located in Nairobi Kenya . Colected data of thyroid information of potential and diagnosed Hypothyroid patients.

The data is provided by Moringa school and can be found [here](http://bit.ly/hypothyroid_data)

I followed in this project the steps of the project management method called CRISP-DM. This method has undergone modifications aimed at the reality of a Data Science project and with that it was called CRISP-DS.

CRISP-DS has the following steps with their respective courts:

### 1 - Business Question

Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.This prediction will help assist in analysing and diagnosing future thyroid patients.

### 2- Understanding the Business
